            <h1>The Difference Between Mac and Windows Computers</h1>
            <p>
                the pros and cons of using Macs or Windows computers. While the differences may not seem immediately apparent, the stark contrast between both systems lends to many a comparison and even controversy. In addition to being produced by two tech giants of the industry, Mac and Windows computers have little in common other than they they both function as home computers. We have chosen this topic as I am an avid Apple user, albeit with a Windows computer at home, while Ivan solely uses Windows machines, so we thought it a fun comparison. We believe this to be an easy topic for us, as we are always and constantly working with these types of machines and can easily compare the two in real time. Weâ€™ll be taking our research from various reviews from various sites, and comparing them extensively.
