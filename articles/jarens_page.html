                <h2>About the Team</h2>
                <p>The Calgary Flames are a professional hockey team in the NHL that are based out of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. They are in the Western Conference and are part of the Pacific Division. The Flames are
                    one of two franchises located in Alberta, the other being the Edmonton Oilers. Because of their close proximity, this has led to a strong and passionate rivalry between the two organizations.
                    They have had numerous notable players in their history. Some of the most notable are Lanny MacDonald, Al McInnis, Joe Nieuwendyk, Jarome Iginla, Miikka Kiprusoff, and Johnny Gaudreau.</p>
                <p>Their arena is the Scotiabank Saddledome, which was built in 1983 for the 1988 Winter Olympics. The arena is now one of the oldest in the league, which has led to discussions and negotiations
                    to build a new one. An agreement for a new building, entitled Scotia Place, was finalized, and construction is set to be completed by 2027.</p>
                <p>The Flames have won one Stanley Cup in 1989, but have had several Stanley Cup Final appearances. Most notably was the 2004 cup run where they lost in 7 games to the Tampa Bay Lightning.
                    They also made it to the finals in 1986, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in 5 games.</p>
                <p>The Flames are now in a rebuilding mode. After many years of mediocrity and failing to win, with a few successful seasons sprinkled in. Several high profile departures such as
                    Johnny Gaudreau and Matthew Tkachuk have forced their hand into rebuilding, with the hopes of being competitive again in a few years.

                <h2>Team History</h2>
                <p>The Calgary Flames did not originate in Calgary. In 1971, the NHL was trying to contend with their competitors, the World Hockey Association (WHA). The NHL established a team in New York,
                    called the New York Islanders in response to the WHA trying to put their team in the Nassau Coliseum arena. Because of this new addition, the NHL needed a second team to balance the
                    schedule, and Atlanta was the city of choice. In Atlanta, the Atlanta Flames were born, led by the same owners who owned the NB's Atlanta Hawks.</p>
                <p>Initally, the Flames were successful, making the playoffs nearly every year, but failing to do much in the playoffs. However, the team struggled off the ice, finanically. The owners
                    were forced to sell the team in order to avoid bankruptcy. An offer came from a Canadian entrpreneur, Nelson Skalbania, who was fronting a group of businessmen from Calgary. After
                    the Atlanta owners tried one final time to keep the team in Atlanta, they eventually sold the team to Nelson Skalbania for 16 million USD. They decided to continue on the name Flames, and
                    in May 1980, it was officially announced that the Flames were coming to Calgary.
