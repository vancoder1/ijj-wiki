            <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
            <h2 id="intro"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
            <p>
                Drifting is more than just a high-speed spectacle—it's an art
                form, a delicate dance between control and chaos. From
                screeching tires to clouds of smoke, the world of drifting
                captivates motorsport fans with its unique blend of precision
                and power. What started as an underground phenomenon on the
                winding mountain roads of Japan has evolved into a global
                motorsport, pushing drivers and cars to their absolute limits.
                In this article, we'll explore the origins of drifting, the
                techniques that define it, and how it has shaped the automotive
                world, both on and off the track.

            <!-- HISTORY OF DRIFTING -->
            <h2 id="history"><b>History of Drifting</b></h2>
            <p class="multicol">
                Drifting traces its origins back to Japan in the 1970s, on the
                twisty mountain roads known as touge. In these mountainous
                regions, a group of daring street racers began experimenting
                with controlled oversteering, sliding their cars through sharp
                corners at high speeds. The goal wasn’t just to be fast but to
                showcase skill and style, a perfect mix of control and risk.
                This new driving technique quickly grew in popularity among
                Japan’s car enthusiasts, especially those inspired by the early
                pioneers of drifting.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                One of the key figures in the birth of drifting was Kunimitsu
                Takahashi, a former motorcycle racer who transitioned to car
                racing. He was the first to master the art of sliding a car
                through corners during his racing career in the All Japan
                Touring Car Championship. His aggressive cornering techniques,
                which involved maintaining high speeds while allowing the rear
                tires to lose traction, laid the foundation for drifting as we
                know it today.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Another significant contributor to the drifting culture was
                Keiichi Tsuchiya, famously known as the "Drift King." Tsuchiya
                popularized drifting in the late 1980s when he applied the
                technique on race tracks and made it part of his competitive
                driving style. He gained a cult following, thanks to his street
                racing exploits and his participation in Best Motoring, a
                popular Japanese car video series. Tsuchiya's iconic 1986 Toyota
                AE86, a lightweight rear-wheel-drive car, became a symbol of
                drifting and is still revered by enthusiasts worldwide. Here's
                an example of his drifting technique:

            </video>
            <br />
            <p>
                As the popularity of drifting grew in Japan, it started to gain
                formal recognition. In 1999, the D1 Grand Prix was launched,
                becoming the first official drifting championship. The
                competition brought structure and legitimacy to the sport, with
                drivers competing not for the fastest lap time but for their
                ability to execute perfect drifts, judged on speed, angle, and
                style. This competition drew in the best drifters from across
                Japan, helping drifting make the leap from an underground
                movement to an internationally recognized motorsport.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                By the early 2000s, drifting began to spread globally, largely
                due to its appearance in video games, car culture magazines, and
                films like The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. These media
                outlets showcased the allure of drifting to new audiences,
                sparking interest in Europe, North America, and beyond. In 2004,
                the United States launched Formula Drift, its own professional
                drifting series, which has since become one of the most
                prestigious drift competitions in the world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Today, drifting is celebrated as both a competitive motorsport
                and a beloved part of car culture. It has evolved from its
                humble beginnings on the mountain passes of Japan into a global
                phenomenon that tests the limits of drivers and machines alike.
                From local drift events to international competitions, the sport
                continues to grow, drawing in new fans and drivers eager to
                master the art of the slide.

            <!-- HOW DRIFTING WORKS -->
            <h2 id="how-it-works"><b>How Drifting Works</b></h2>
            <p>
                At its core, drifting is the art of controlling a car while it's
                sliding sideways through a corner, with the rear tires losing
                traction while the driver maintains precise control of the
                vehicle. This dramatic maneuver is not just about losing
                grip—it’s about manipulating the car’s balance and momentum to
                keep it in a controlled slide, often at high speeds. To
                understand how drifting works, we need to break down the
                techniques, physics, and car mechanics that make this high-skill
                motorsport possible.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Basic Drifting Techniques There are several methods to initiate
                a drift, each requiring a different combination of driver input
                and car setup. Here are some of the most common techniques used
                in drifting:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Handbrake Turn (E-Brake Drift):</i></b> One of the
                    easiest and most common ways to initiate a drift, especially
                    for beginners. The driver pulls the handbrake while steering
                    into a corner, causing the rear wheels to lock and the car
                    to slide. This technique is often used to kick off a drift
                    at slower speeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Power Oversteer (Power Slide):</i></b> In this
                    technique, the driver uses the car’s raw power to break
                    traction. By applying a sudden burst of throttle in a
                    rear-wheel-drive car while turning, the rear tires lose
                    grip, allowing the car to slide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Clutch Kick:</i></b> This method involves depressing
                    the clutch while revving the engine, then releasing it
                    quickly to send a surge of power to the rear wheels, causing
                    them to spin and break traction. It’s especially useful in
                    lower-powered drift cars where additional torque is needed
                    to initiate the slide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Feint Drift:</i></b> A more advanced technique, this
                    involves the driver steering briefly away from the corner
                    before flicking the car back into the turn. This transfer of
                    weight from one side to the other helps initiate the drift
                    by unsettling the car's rear end.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Brake Drift:</i></b> The driver enters the corner at
                    high speed and lightly taps the brake while steering,
                    transferring weight to the front of the car and causing the
                    rear to lose grip.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>The Physics of Drifting</h5>
            <p>
                Drifting hinges on the delicate balance between traction and
                momentum. Here’s how it works from a physics perspective:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Traction Loss:</i></b> Drifting occurs when the rear
                    tires lose traction but remain within the driver's control.
                    The goal is to maintain a loss of traction in the rear while
                    keeping the front tires gripping the road. This enables the
                    driver to steer through the corner while sliding sideways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Counter-Steering:</i></b> As the car begins to slide,
                    the driver must counter-steer—turn the steering wheel in the
                    opposite direction of the drift—to maintain control and
                    prevent a spinout. For example, if the car’s rear is sliding
                    out to the right, the driver turns the wheel to the left to
                    stabilize the drift.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Weight Transfer:</i></b> Effective drifting involves
                    understanding how weight shifts within the car. When a car
                    accelerates, its weight shifts to the rear, while braking or
                    deceleration shifts weight to the front. Drifting techniques
                    often rely on this weight transfer to initiate or maintain a
                    slide. Skilled drifters can manipulate this weight transfer
                    to control the drift more precisely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Throttle Control:</i></b> Throughout the drift, the
                    driver must carefully modulate the throttle to adjust the
                    car’s angle and speed. Applying too much throttle can cause
                    the car to spin, while too little can cause it to regain
                    traction and end the drift.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h5>Car Setup for Drifting</h5>
            <p>
                Not all cars are capable of drifting—specific setups are
                necessary to handle the demands of this motorsport. While it is
                possible to drift in front-wheel-drive cars, rear-wheel-drive
                (RWD) or all-wheel-drive (AWD) cars are preferred because they
                offer better control when inducing oversteer. Here are key
                aspects of a typical drift car setup:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD):</i></b> Most drift cars are
                    rear-wheel-drive, as this configuration allows the rear
                    tires to lose traction while the front tires maintain
                    steering control.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Tires:</i></b> Drift cars often use special tires with
                    lower grip in the rear to make it easier to initiate and
                    maintain a drift. Some drift drivers may also use worn or
                    inexpensive tires during practice to save money since
                    drifting wears out tires quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Suspension:</i></b> A stiff suspension setup is
                    crucial for better weight transfer control. Drift cars are
                    typically lowered to lower the center of gravity and prevent
                    body roll during aggressive maneuvers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Limited-Slip Differential (LSD):</i></b> An LSD
                    ensures that both rear wheels spin together, even when one
                    loses traction, making it easier to initiate and maintain a
                    controlled slide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>Engine Power:</i></b> While high horsepower isn't
                    required to drift, many competitive drift cars are heavily
                    modified for more power, allowing the driver to maintain
                    long, sustained drifts at higher speeds.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h5>The Balance Between Art and Science</h5>
            <p>
                Drifting <del>is</del> <ins>isn't</ins> just about brute force or reckless driving—it’s a
                sophisticated dance between the driver, the car, and the laws of
                physics. Skilled drifters must have an intimate understanding of
                their car’s behavior at the limit, making split-second
                adjustments to throttle, steering, and braking to keep the car
                sliding precisely where they want it. The combination of power,
                finesse, and an understanding of mechanics makes drifting both a
                science and an art.

            <h2 id="performance"><b>Performance and Skill on Track</b></h2>
            <p>
                On the track, drifting showcases the fine balance between car
                setup, driver skill, and physics. Unlike grip racing, where
                speed and lap times are the ultimate goals, drifting emphasizes
                style, angle, and car control at the edge of traction. Each type
                of driving—drifting and grip—requires different techniques,
                setups, and priorities. Here’s a breakdown of how performance in
                drifting compares to traditional grip driving.

            <h2 id="conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
            <p>
                Drifting, with its roots in Japan’s mountain passes, has evolved
                into a global motorsport and cultural phenomenon. What began as
                a rebellion against traditional racing has become an art form in
                its own right—one that values style, control, and precision as
                much as speed. From its unique history to the high-performance
                skills required to master it, drifting offers a thrilling
                alternative to conventional motorsports.

                On the track, drifting showcases the delicate balance between
                technique and physics. While it may not always be the fastest
                way to navigate a corner, especially on asphalt, it remains an
                unparalleled demonstration of car control. In rally racing,
                where grip is limited, drifting proves its effectiveness by
                allowing drivers to maintain speed in treacherous conditions.
                Whether judged by style or performance, drifting captures the
                imagination of car enthusiasts and racers alike, standing as a
                testament to the skill and creativity of those who dare to
                master the slide.

                As motorsport continues to evolve, drifting holds a special
                place, bridging the gap between competition and artistry. It
                celebrates the thrill of pushing the limits and keeping a car on
                the edge of control, turning every corner into a dynamic
                performance. In this way, drifting not only pushes the
                boundaries of racing but also keeps alive the spirit of
                innovation, passion, and pure driving enjoyment.
